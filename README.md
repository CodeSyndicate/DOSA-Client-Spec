Client
======

The JavaScript client-server communication layer for all CodeSyndicate applications.

## Purpose

DOSA should be able to handle your client to server calls through AJAX and REST services so that you don't have to build them into your applictaion as long as it is DOSA compliant. All client-server communication will be handled through the client and the server implementation. This allows DOSA to manage the distribution of actions automatically so that you can work on building awesome client or server code depending on your skills. Let DOSA handle the boring stuff.
